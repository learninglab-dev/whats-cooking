The project asks the students to create educational materials, perhaps a campaign, to teach the public about some aspect of jails. To support these students, we need to help them think about what they're teaching and how different mediums can effectively get their message across. These mediums will include games, videos, graphics, and podcasts. No experience necessary, but you'll need to learn at least one of these media to be able to help students at their workshops and hackathons, AND you really should attend the brainstorming session at 1p on Wednesday 10/10.\n",
